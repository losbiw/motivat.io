### Extended goal explanation
Lately I've been struggling with doing almost anything, including most basic things (e.g. leaving my bed, eating food, etc.). 

One thing that used to help a lot to cope was overworking myself, giving myself more tasks than I could actually complete in a given period of time. Without any further doubts it led to an even bigger burnout eventually, to the point where I couldn't do anything anymore.

I am not the type of person to speak about my problems publicly, and if you're reading this you are most probably as well. Mental health is an extremely important part of a human being, which is why if you're feeling the same way I used to (this is a UPD of the original readme) I strongly encourage you to see a professional. You matter, lad, so don't be a moronic psycho and finally book an appointment with a therapist. Once you feel like going back here, you should try "Motivat.io" to help you get back on track. It might help you learn things that have been your hidden passion for years while you're recovering, like foreign languages, advanced algebra, or whatever makes you happy.

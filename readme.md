### Extended goal explanation
Lately I've been struggling with doing almost anything, even most basic things like leaving my bed, forcing myself to eat and such. What usually would help me deal with that feeling was overworking myself (call it whatever you want, but basically giving myself so much job that I would simply not have the time to think about bad things), but at some point it just didn't help anymore and I felt absolutely burnt out. I wouldn't talk about this so openly, but I really wanna help people like me who are just unlucky to not have the time of their life at the moment, and that's exactly why I decided to create "Motivat.io". The app is focused towards constatly reminding people to do things that they've always wanted to do, like learning a new language or studying advanced algebra, but who always forget to or simply can't make themselves do so
